In this update, we are excited to share the latest advancements in Nemomobile. The development efforts have been focused on two key areas: porting Nemomobile to Qt6 and extending compatibility with Halium devices.

## Towards Qt6

The Qt6 porting process for Nemomobile has been a major focus of Sergey’s efforts this month. Specifically, Sergey has been diligently working on porting [Qt Quick Controls Nemo to Qt6](https://github.com/nemomobile-ux/qtquickcontrols-nemo/tree/qt6).

## Halium devices

Barry showcased a proof of concept on the Xiaomi Redmi 7, successfully demonstrating the compatibility of Nemomobile. Similarly, NfX accomplished a successful boot of Nemo on the Xiaomi Poco.

These remarkable achievements were shared within the [Manjaro libhybris](https://t.me/manjaroonhalium) telegram group,
allowing the community to witness the [progress](https://github.com/manjaro-libhybris/arm-profiles/tree/master/devices).
It’s worth noting that the project utilized the available images from the [GitHub CI repository](https://github.com/manjaro-libhybris/image-ci/releases),
providing a solid foundation for the development process.
