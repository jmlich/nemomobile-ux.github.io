Hello again!

For some time I've been wanting to jump ship from SailfishOS, and Nemomobile was seemingly
the answer i've been seeking. Nemo mobile is alternative mobile OS similar to SailfishOS,
so much so that until recently you were able to install Nemo gui on sailfishos because
they shared the base. To this day SailfishOS base is called nemo and many elements
in SailfishOS are called Nemo.

Okay Nemo it is but why redesign it?

Now that this is out of the way (I REALLY hope I don't have to explain why) what is
the plan? Well general plan is that we want nemo to be looking great and feel great,
port all my apps to it and make compatibility layer for sfos apps. Waydroid or whatever
android apps thing is current at the day you're reading it should work fine as well and
all the plasma mobile etc apps should work too, so if all goes well we should have highest
app compatibility of all OS's, but frankly, my apps is all I need and most people
want (not my words).

As first step we wanted to make design of entire OS but that turned out to be too much
to handle. Oh and when referring to us I mean me and my designer gregguh@telegram. So we
settled on changing small elements first, like basic building blocks, starting with switches
shown above, after which we'll crawl our way up and slowly redesign entire operating system.

For now I've managed to port nemo to openSUSE so that I can work on it on my computer without
hassle [build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:NemoMobile](build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:NemoMobile).
So I'm going to start work soon as the design is in already.

This is more of a beginning of the series. I'll document every struggle and process of redesigning entire OS going forward so stay tuned.
