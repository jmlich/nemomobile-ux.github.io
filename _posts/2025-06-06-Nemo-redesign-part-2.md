Hello again!

After making couple PRs to sailfishos so that I can get nemo building on opensuse again, and after finishing bunch of my apps I've finally decided to sit down and work on the checkbox redesign and here's the result:

I have nothing much more to add, It looks sweet, I've fixed sliding animation as well as added some easing, adjusted timing and size. Off to redesigning button!
